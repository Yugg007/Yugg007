Hi, I'm Shreyas Londhe, a passionate self-taught frontend stack web developer and a freelance software engineer from india. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am also an Open-source and Blockchain enthusiast. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through Open-source.
